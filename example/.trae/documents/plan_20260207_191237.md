I have reviewed `app_main.cpp` against `info.md` for Cardputer configuration.

**Discrepancies found:**
1.  **I2S Speaker (NS4168)**:
    *   `info.md`: BCLK=41, SDATA=42, LRCLK=43.
    *   `app_main.cpp`: BCLK=41, SDATA=42, WS(LRCLK)=43.
    *   **Match**: Yes.

2.  **I2S Mic (SPM1423)**:
    *   `info.md`: DAT=46, CLK=43.
    *   `app_main.cpp`: CLK=43, DIN=46.
    *   **Match**: Yes.
    *   **Note**: Mic CLK (43) and Speaker LRCLK (43) share the same pin. This confirms they should be on the same I2S bus or managed carefully. Currently, they are on separate buses (`I2S_NUM_0` for Speaker, `I2S_NUM_1` for Mic). Since they share a pin, enabling both simultaneously with different controllers driving pin 43 will cause conflict. However, for now, the configuration values are correct per the document.

3.  **SPI Display (ST7789V2)**:
    *   `info.md`: SCK=36, DAT(MOSI)=35, CS=37, RS(DC)=34, RST=33, BL=38.
    *   `app_main.cpp`:
        *   `spi_bus_config`: SCK=36, MOSI=35, MISO=NC. (**Match**)
        *   `spi_display_config`: CS=37, DC=34, RST=33. (**Match**)
        *   **Missing**: Backlight (BL) pin G38 is not in `spi_display_config` (it has no BL param) or handled separately. It should be handled as a GPIO or PWM.

4.  **I2C (Grove)**:
    *   `info.md`: SDA=2, SCL=1.
    *   `app_main.cpp`: SDA=2, SCL=1.
    *   **Match**: Yes.

5.  **SD Card**:
    *   `info.md`: CS=12, MOSI=14, CLK=40, MISO=39.
    *   `app_main.cpp`: Commented out, but matches notes.

6.  **IR**:
    *   `info.md`: TX=44.
    *   `app_main.cpp`: Not configured (Comment mentions it).

**Action Plan:**
*   The configurations in `app_main.cpp` match `info.md`.
*   I will add a comment about the shared pin G43 for Speaker and Mic to be explicit.
*   I will also add the Backlight GPIO configuration if possible, or just leave it as is since the user asked to "check config parameters".
*   The user said "check config parameters, based on md doc".
*   The parameters *are* correct.
*   I will confirm this to the user.

However, looking at `app_main.cpp`:
`spi_bus_config`: `GPIO_NUM_35` (MOSI), `GPIO_NUM_36` (SCLK). Matches.
`spi_display_config`: `GPIO_NUM_37` (CS), `GPIO_NUM_34` (DC), `GPIO_NUM_33` (RST). Matches.

Wait, I should check `spi_bus_config` again.
Line 57: `GPIO_NUM_35, // mosi` -> Matches DAT G35.
Line 59: `GPIO_NUM_36, // sclk` -> Matches SCK G36.

I2C:
Line 88: `GPIO_NUM_2` (SDA). Matches G2.
Line 89: `GPIO_NUM_1` (SCL). Matches G1.

I2S Speaker:
Line 127: `GPIO_NUM_41` (bclk). Matches G41.
Line 128: `GPIO_NUM_43` (ws). Matches LRCLK G43.
Line 129: `GPIO_NUM_42` (dout). Matches SDATA G42.

I2S Mic:
Line 157: `GPIO_NUM_43` (clk). Matches CLK G43.
Line 158: `GPIO_NUM_46` (din). Matches DAT G46.

Everything looks correct.

I will simply report that the parameters are correct and match the documentation.
Or did the user imply I should *fix* something? "Check... and fix/regenerate"?
"Check config parameters, based on md doc" -> "Check and ensure they are correct".
Since they appear correct, I will just confirm.

Wait, I missed one detail in `info.md`.
"Keyboard: Row Inputs (Y7~Y0) | G13, G15, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7".
"Keyboard: Col Select A2 (74HC138) | G11".
"Keyboard: Col Select A1 (74HC138) | G9".
"Keyboard: Col Select A0 (74HC138) | G8".
This is not configured in `app_main.cpp` yet (commented out).

I will conclude the check.

One potential issue: `I2S_NUM_1` for Mic. `info.md` doesn't specify I2S port, but since pins share, using `NUM_1` allows independent config but electrical conflict if both active. This is a design constraint of the board, not a config error.

I'll assume the task is just to verify the existing code matches the doc.

I will verify the `spi_display_config` matches `SpiDisplayConfig` struct.
Line 70.
`GPIO_NUM_37` (CS).
`GPIO_NUM_34` (DC).
`0` (spi_mode).
`40000000` (clock).
...
`GPIO_NUM_33` (reset).

It seems fine.

I will output a confirmation.
