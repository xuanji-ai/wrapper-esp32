The compilation errors indicate incorrect struct member names and types in `I2sChanPdmTxConfig`:

1.  `i2s_pdm_usr_t` is not declared. The error suggests `up_sample_fp` in `clk_cfg` member. I suspect the type might be `i2s_pdm_tx_up_sample_rate_t` or similar, or maybe `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t` uses `up_sample_fp` which is of a different type.
    *   Actually, `i2s_pdm_rx_clk_config_t` uses `dn_sample_mode` (type `i2s_pdm_dsr_t`).
    *   For TX, it seems it uses `up_sample_fp` (Floating Point upsampling?).
    *   Let's check `driver/i2s_pdm.h` if possible, or infer from error.
    *   Error says: `struct i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t` has no member named `up_sample_mode`; did you mean `up_sample_fp`?
    *   So the member is `up_sample_fp`.
    *   The type of `up_sample_fp` is likely NOT `i2s_pdm_usr_t`. It might be `uint32_t` or `float` or a specific enum.
    *   Usually PDM TX upsampling is fixed or configured differently.
    *   Wait, `up_sample_fp` sounds like "First Stage"? Or "Frequency Parameter"?
    *   Actually, I'll search for `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t` definition or usage examples.
    *   Or I can just use `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t` and see what members it has. The error gave a hint: `up_sample_fp`.
    *   Wait, if I don't know the type of `up_sample_fp`, I can't construct the constructor properly.
    *   I will try to search for `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t` definition using `SearchCodebase`.

2.  `struct i2s_pdm_tx_slot_config_t` has no member named `slot_mask`; did you mean `slot_mode`?
    *   PDM TX might not support slot mask in the same way as Rx or TDM.
    *   PDM TX is usually stereo (2 lines) or mono.
    *   Maybe it uses `line_mode` or just `slot_mode` covers it.
    *   I will check `i2s_pdm_tx_slot_config_t` definition.

Let's search for the definitions.
