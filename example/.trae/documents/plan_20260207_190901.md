The search results did not explicitly show the definition of `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t` or `i2s_pdm_tx_slot_config_t`, but I can infer the correct members from the error messages and general ESP-IDF patterns.

**Error Analysis:**
1.  `'i2s_pdm_usr_t' has not been declared`: This means I cannot use this type. The correct type for up-sampling configuration is likely implied by the member name in the config struct.
2.  `struct i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t has no member named 'up_sample_mode'; did you mean 'up_sample_fp'?`: This tells me the member name is `up_sample_fp`.
3.  `struct i2s_pdm_tx_slot_config_t has no member named 'slot_mask'; did you mean 'slot_mode'?`: This implies PDM TX doesn't use `slot_mask`, only `slot_mode`.

**Plan:**
1.  **Fix `I2sChanPdmTxConfig` in `wrapper/i2s.hpp`**:
    *   Change the constructor parameter type for up-sampling from `i2s_pdm_usr_t` to `uint32_t` (or `i2s_pdm_tx_up_sample_rate_t` if I could confirm it, but `up_sample_fp` suggests frequency parameter or fixed point? No, usually it's "Frequency Parameter" or similar. Wait, `up_sample_fp` might stand for "Up Sample Frequency Parameter"?).
    *   Actually, let's look at `i2s_pdm_rx_clk_config_t`. It had `dn_sample_mode`.
    *   For TX, `up_sample_fp` is likely `i2s_pdm_tx_up_sample_fp_t`? Or just `uint32_t`?
    *   The error message suggested `up_sample_fp`.
    *   Let's check if I can use `auto` or just remove it if it's optional? No, I need to initialize it.
    *   I will guess `i2s_pdm_tx_up_sample_fp_t` or similar. But `i2s_pdm_usr_t` was my guess for "Up Sample Rate".
    *   Wait, I can assume `up_sample_fp` is the member name. The type is the question.
    *   If I check `driver/i2s_pdm.h` via `Read` (if I could), I would know. But I can't read system files directly easily.
    *   However, I can try to use `uint32_t` or `int` for `up_sample_fp` as a safe bet if it's a value, or look for enum names like `I2S_PDM_TX_UP_SAMPLE_FP_...`.
    *   Actually, I will remove the explicit type `i2s_pdm_usr_t` and use `uint32_t` or generic, OR I will just remove the parameter if I can set a default.
    *   But wait, `clk_cfg.up_sample_fp` exists.
    *   Let's assume the type is `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::up_sample_fp` type.
    *   I will search specifically for `up_sample_fp` usage in the codebase or just assume `uint32_t`/`int`.
    *   Actually, in `i2s_pdm_rx_config_t`, `dn_sample_mode` was `i2s_pdm_dsr_t`.
    *   Maybe for TX it is `i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::up_sample_fp`.
    *   Let's try to remove `slot_mask` usage first.

2.  **Fix `slot_mask`**:
    *   Remove `slot_mask` from `I2sChanPdmTxConfig`. PDM TX is usually just stereo/mono via `slot_mode`.

3.  **Fix `up_sample_mode`**:
    *   Rename member access to `up_sample_fp`.
    *   Change constructor parameter name/type.
    *   I will check if `I2S_PDM_TX_UP_SAMPLE_FP_...` exists.
    *   If not sure, I'll use `uint32_t` and default to `0` (or valid default).

Let's modify `wrapper/i2s.hpp`.
