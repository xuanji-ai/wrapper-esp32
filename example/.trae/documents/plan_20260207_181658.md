I need to implement `Speaker` and `Microphone` classes in `wrapper/audio.cpp`. These classes were defined in `wrapper/audio.hpp` (as `Speaker` and `Microphone` - formerly I referred to them as `AudioNone` or similar, but the user's `Read` output shows `Speaker` and `Microphone` classes with comments `// no codec`).

**1. Analyze `Speaker` and `Microphone` Classes**

*   **`Speaker`**:
    *   No codec dev handle.
    *   Uses `I2sBus` directly.
    *   Has `volume_` and `mute_` (software implementation implied).
    *   Methods: `Init`, `Deinit`, `SetSoftVolume`, `GetSoftVolume`, `SetMute`, `IsMuted`, `Enable`, `Disable`, `Write`.
*   **`Microphone`**:
    *   No codec dev handle.
    *   Uses `I2sBus` directly.
    *   Has `volume_` (gain?) and `mute_`.
    *   Methods: `Init`, `Deinit`, `SetSoftVolume`, `GetSoftVolume`, `SetMute`, `IsMuted`, `Enable`, `Disable`, `Read`.

**2. Implementation Details**

*   **Init**: Store `I2sBus` pointer.
*   **Enable/Disable**: Call `i2s_bus_->EnableTxChannel()` / `DisableTxChannel()` (for Speaker) or Rx (for Mic).
*   **Write (Speaker)**:
    *   If `mute_` is true, write zeros or just return true? Writing zeros keeps timing.
    *   If `volume_` != 1.0, scale samples?
    *   `Write` takes `void*`. Assuming 16-bit samples?
    *   If `SetSoftVolume` is used, we need to know the format to scale.
    *   For now, I will implement `Write` as a direct pass-through to `i2s_bus_->Write` if no volume scaling is applied.
    *   If software volume is required, I need to cast `data` to `int16_t*` (assuming 16-bit) and scale.
    *   Given the prompt "Implement Speaker and Microphone", I should implement the basic logic.
    *   I'll assume 16-bit audio for software volume scaling as it's most common on ESP32.
*   **Read (Microphone)**:
    *   Call `i2s_bus_->Read`.
    *   Apply scaling/mute if needed.

**3. Plan**

*   Implement `Speaker` methods in `wrapper/audio.cpp`.
*   Implement `Microphone` methods in `wrapper/audio.cpp`.
*   Ensure I use the class names `Speaker` and `Microphone` as declared in `audio.hpp` (I see them in the `Read` output of `audio.hpp` in lines 12 and 49).

Let's do this.
