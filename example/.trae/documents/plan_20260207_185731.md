The compilation error indicates that `i2s_pdm_rx_clk_config_t` does not have a member named `ext_clk_freq_hz`. This is because PDM Rx clock configuration is simpler than standard I2S or TDM, and often doesn't involve an external clock frequency parameter in the same way, or the struct definition in the ESP-IDF version being used differs.

I will fix this by removing `clk_cfg.ext_clk_freq_hz = ext_clk_freq_hz;` from the `I2sChanPdmRxConfig` constructor in `wrapper/i2s.hpp`.

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `wrapper/i2s.hpp`**:
    *   Locate the `I2sChanPdmRxConfig` constructor.
    *   Remove the line `clk_cfg.ext_clk_freq_hz = ext_clk_freq_hz;`.
    *   Also remove the `uint32_t ext_clk_freq_hz` parameter from the constructor signature to match.
    *   Update `wrapper/i2s.hpp` declaration.

2.  **Modify `main/app_main.cpp`**:
    *   Update the `i2s_mic_chan_cfg` instantiation to remove the `ext_clk_freq_hz` argument (which was passed as `0`).

This should resolve the build error.
