The compilation error `request for member 'init' in 'keyboard', which is of non-class type 'KEYBOARD::Keyboard()'` is caused by the way the `keyboard` object is instantiated in `app_main.cpp`.

Line 158: `KEYBOARD::Keyboard keyboard();`

This is known as the "Most Vexing Parse" in C++. It declares a function named `keyboard` that takes no arguments and returns a `KEYBOARD::Keyboard` object, rather than instantiating an object named `keyboard`.

**Solution:**
Remove the parentheses from the declaration.

Change:
`KEYBOARD::Keyboard keyboard();`

To:
`KEYBOARD::Keyboard keyboard;`

I will apply this fix to `app_main.cpp`.
