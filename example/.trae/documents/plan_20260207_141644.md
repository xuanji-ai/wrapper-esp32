I will create a comprehensive optimization report for the `src` directory, focusing on code consistency, missing implementations, and best practices.

**1. Create Document** **`src_optimization_report.md`**

*   **Overview**: Summarize the current state of the codebase (mostly well-structured, consistent wrapper pattern).
*   **Critical Findings**:
    *   `src/device/ili9341.{hpp,cpp}` are empty/missing.
    *   `src/device/axp2101.{hpp,cpp}` are incomplete (class defined but no methods).
*   **Optimization Suggestions**:
    *   **Consistency**: Ensure all remaining classes (e.g., any found in `device/`) follow the `bool` return type pattern used in `wrapper/`.
    *   **Magic Numbers**: Recommend moving register addresses (like in `Ip5306`) to `static constexpr` or `enum class`.
    *   **Documentation**: Suggest adding Doxygen-style comments to public interfaces.
    *   **Resource Management**: Verify `Deinit` is called in all destructors (seems mostly good, but worth a checklist).
    *   **Modern C++ Usage**: Suggest using `std::span` for data buffers instead of `std::vector` reference or pointer/length pairs where non-owning access is sufficient.
*   **Specific File Recommendations**: detailed breakdown for key files.

**2. Follow-up Actions**
*   Ask the user if they want me to implement the missing `Axp2101` or `Ili9341` drivers or proceed with other refactoring.

**File to be created:**
*   `/home/nixy/ws/wrapper-esp32/example/src_optimization_report.md` (I will place it in the example root or the project root as appropriate, likely `wrapper-esp32/example/` based on current cwd).

I will start by writing this report.
