I still have compilation errors:
1.  `no declaration matches 'bool wrapper::Microphone::Read(void*, size_t)'`
2.  `no declaration matches 'bool wrapper::SpeakerCodec::Write(const void*, size_t)'`

This usually means the header file `wrapper/audio.hpp` and source file `wrapper/audio.cpp` are out of sync, or the tool didn't apply the changes correctly in the previous step (even though it said it did).

**1. Verify `wrapper/audio.hpp`**

I will read `wrapper/audio.hpp` to check the declarations of `Microphone::Read` and `SpeakerCodec::Write`.

**2. Verify `wrapper/audio.cpp`**

I will read `wrapper/audio.cpp` to check the implementations.

**3. Hypothesis**

*   `Microphone::Read` declaration might be missing or have a different signature in HPP.
*   `SpeakerCodec::Write` declaration might be missing or have a different signature in HPP.

I will read both files completely to be sure.

**4. Fix**

Once I see the discrepancy, I will correct the HPP or CPP to match.

Let's start by reading the files.
