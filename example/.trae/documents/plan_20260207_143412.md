I will extract the GT911 touch controller code and configuration from `src/board/m5stack/tab5.cpp` and `src/board/m5stack/tab5.hpp` and refactor it into a new class `Gt911` in `src/device/gt911.hpp` and `src/device/gt911.cpp`, inheriting from `I2cTouch`.

**1. Create** **`src/device/gt911.hpp`**

*   Define the `Gt911` class, inheriting from `wrapper::I2cTouch`.
*   Include necessary headers.
*   Expose an `Init` method that takes `I2cBus` and `I2cTouchConfig` (or potentially handles the config internally if it's device-specific, but the `tab5.cpp` config is quite specific to the board wiring).
*   However, following the pattern from `ili9881c`, I will likely keep the board-specific config separate or allow it to be passed in, but wrap the `esp_lcd_touch_new_i2c_gt911` call.

**2. Create** **`src/device/gt911.cpp`**

*   Implement the `Init` method.
*   It will call `I2cTouch::Init` with `esp_lcd_touch_new_i2c_gt911`.

**3. Refactor** **`src/board/m5stack/tab5.cpp`**

*   Include `device/gt911.hpp`.
*   Replace `I2cTouch gt911_touch` with `Gt911 gt911_touch`.
*   Update `Init` to use the new class.

**4. Refactor** **`src/board/m5stack/tab5.hpp`**

*   Update `GetGt911Touch` return type to `Gt911&`.

**Details on Configuration:**
The `gt911_touch_cfg` in `tab5.cpp` is a large struct initialization. I should move this configuration into the board file (keep it there) or create a default config in the `Gt911` class if it's reusable. Given it specifies I2C address, pins (NC), resolution (1280x800), it seems board-specific. I will keep the config in `tab5.cpp` but maybe cleaner.
Wait, the user said "extract touch code and config".
If I extract the config to `Gt911` class, it becomes less flexible for other boards. But `device/gt911.hpp` *is* the driver wrapper.
I will create `Gt911` as a wrapper that simplifies initialization.
`Init(I2cBus& bus, const I2cTouchConfig& config)` -> calls `I2cTouch::Init(bus, config, esp_lcd_touch_new_i2c_gt911)`.

This is consistent with `Ili9341` and `Ili9881c` refactoring.

**Plan:**
1.  **`src/device/gt911.hpp`**: Class definition.
2.  **`src/device/gt911.cpp`**: Implementation.
3.  **`src/board/m5stack/tab5.cpp`**: Use `Gt911` class, pass `gt911_touch_cfg` (which remains in `tab5.cpp` but maybe I can move the specific pin/res values to `tab5.cpp`'s `Init` or keep as a file-scope variable).
    *   The user request says "extract ... config".
    *   I will keep the config in `tab5.cpp` because it depends on board resolution.
    *   Or, I could make `Gt911` take `width`, `height`, `addr` and build the config internally? No, `I2cTouchConfig` is complex.
    *   I'll stick to: `Gt911` wraps the `new_touch_func`.

**Note:** `I2cTouch` in `wrapper/touch.hpp` has `Init` returning `bool`. My new `Gt911::Init` should also return `bool`.

Let's do this.
