Based on the analysis of the crash (`Store access fault` at `dw_gdma_ll_channel_set_link_list_master_port`) and comparison with the official BSP `m5stack_tab5.c`, I have identified the following discrepancies that likely cause the GDMA crash:

1.  **LVGL Buffer Location (`buff_spiram`)**:
    *   **Current**: `buff_spiram = true` (Allocates draw buffer in PSRAM).
    *   **Official BSP**: `buff_spiram = false` (Allocates draw buffer in Internal RAM).
    *   **Reasoning**: The GDMA engine used by the MIPI DSI peripheral (or the specific linked list configuration) might have restrictions or coherency issues when accessing the draw buffer in PSRAM for this specific configuration. Moving the buffer to Internal RAM (which is faster and guaranteed to be DMA-safe) aligns with the official BSP and likely resolves the `Store access fault`.

2.  **Buffer Size**:
    *   **Current**: `BSP_LCD_H_RES * 100` (72000 pixels).
    *   **Official BSP**: `BSP_LCD_H_RES * 50` (36000 pixels).
    *   **Action**: Reduce buffer size to 50 lines to save Internal RAM space, matching the BSP default.

3.  **DPI Panel Configuration (`esp_lcd_dpi_panel_config_t`)**:
    *   **Current**: Sets `.pixel_format` and `.out_color_format` which are not present in the official BSP initialization.
    *   **Official BSP**: Only sets `.in_color_format`.
    *   **Action**: Remove the extra fields to ensure the structure matches the driver's expectation as per the working BSP.

4.  **Panel Device Configuration (`esp_lcd_panel_dev_config_t`)**:
    *   **Current**: Sets `.data_endian = LCD_RGB_DATA_ENDIAN_BIG`.
    *   **Official BSP**: Uses default (does not set this field).
    *   **Action**: Remove the explicit setting to rely on the default, ensuring alignment with BSP.

**Plan Implementation:**
I will modify `src/board/m5stack/tab5.cpp` to:
1.  Update `esp_lcd_dpi_panel_config_t dpi_config` to remove `.pixel_format` and `.out_color_format`.
2.  Update `esp_lcd_panel_dev_config_t panel_config` to remove `.data_endian`.
3.  Update `lvgl_display_config` to use `buff_spiram = false` and `height = 50` lines.

This should resolve the GDMA crash by ensuring the frame buffer is in the correct memory region and the DSI driver is configured exactly as the official BSP.
